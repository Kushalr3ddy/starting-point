- two types of file inclusion(i.e acessing file) external and internal internal uses shid liek /../ 
-external uses //host/filename using smb to get file from external source
|
-working of nltm in brief:

The client sends a username to the host.
The host responds with a random number (i.e. the challenge).
The client then generates a hashed password value from this number and the user’s password, and then sends this back as a response.
The host knows the user’s password and generates a hashed password value which it can then compare to the client’s response.
If both values match, the authenticity of the client is confirmed, and network access is granted. If there is no match between the values, the client will be denied access.
